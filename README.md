ClipCrunch: Video Summarization Workflow

ClipCrunch is a web-based application designed to provide quick and efficient video summarization using Amazon Cloud Services. The workflow starts with the user entering the URL of a video into a simple and intuitive interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once the URL is provided, the system extracts the audio from the video, isolating the voice-over content for processing.

The extracted audio is then uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket, ensuring secure and reliable storage. From there, the audio is passed to Amazon Transcribe, a powerful service that converts speech into a textual transcript. This step transforms the spoken content of the video into readable text while maintaining accuracy and context.

Next, the generated text transcript is sent to Amazon Bedrock, where the Llama model processes it. This model analyzes the text and produces a concise, meaningful summary of the video's content. The summarization focuses on retaining the key points and essential information, making it easier for users to grasp the main ideas of the video without needing to watch it.

Finally, the summarized text is displayed on the web interface, allowing users to quickly access and understand the core content of the video. This efficient integration of Amazon S3, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Bedrock ensures a seamless workflow and a reliable summarization process.

ClipCrunch offers a practical and time-saving solution for users who need to process video content quickly, making it an excellent tool for enhancing productivity and accessibility. By leveraging cloud services and advanced AI models, ClipCrunch delivers accurate and meaningful summaries with minimal user effort.
