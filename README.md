# ClipCrunch
ClipCrunch simplifies video summarization using AWS. Users input a video URL, and the system extracts audio, stores it in Amazon S3, and converts it to text using Amazon Transcribe. The text is summarized by the Llama model on Amazon Bedrock and displayed on the web interface for quick access.
